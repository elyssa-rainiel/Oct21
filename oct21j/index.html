     <p>Baking and its history started way back in Ancient Egypt in 2,600 BC. It's one of the oldest cooking methods. <span class="highlight">Egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they also used for brewing beer. Baking also became a highly regarded profession during the Roman Empire in 300 BC.</span> The 14,000-year-old crumbs suggest that ancient tribes were quite adept at food-making techniques, and developed them earlier than we had given them credit for. The established archaeological doctrine states that humans first began baking bread about 10,000 years ago. That was a pivotal time in our evolution.</p>
